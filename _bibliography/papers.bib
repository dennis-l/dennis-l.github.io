     abstract = "{We use polarization data from SOFIA HAWC+ to investigate the interplay
        between magnetic fields and stellar feedback in altering gas
        dynamics within the high-mass star-forming region RCW 36,
        located in Vela C. This region is of particular interest as it
        has a bipolar H II region powered by a massive star cluster,
        which may be impacting the surrounding magnetic field. To
        determine if this is the case, we apply the histogram of
        relative orientations (HRO) method to quantify the relative
        alignment between the inferred magnetic field and elongated
        structures observed in several data sets such as dust emission,
        column density, temperature, and spectral line intensity maps.
        The HRO results indicate a bimodal alignment trend, where
        structures observed with dense gas tracers show a statistically
        significant preference for perpendicular alignment relative to
        the magnetic field, while structures probed by the
        photodissociation region (PDR) tracers tend to align
        preferentially parallel relative to the magnetic field.
        Moreover, the dense gas and PDR associated structures are found
        to be kinematically distinct such that a bimodal alignment trend
        is also observed as a function of line-of-sight velocity. This
        suggests that the magnetic field may have been dynamically
        important and set a preferred direction of gas flow at the time
        that RCW 36 formed, resulting in a dense ridge developing
        perpendicular to the magnetic field. However, on filament scales
        near the PDR region, feedback may be energetically dominating
        the magnetic field, warping its geometry and the associated
        flux-frozen gas structures, causing the observed preference for
        parallel relative alignment.}",

        density and temperature maps for each cloud. We fit for the
        slope of the polarization spectrum at each sky position in each
        cloud, and using the Pearson r coefficient, we probe each cloud
        for possible correlations of slope with column density and slope
        with temperature. We also create plots of slope versus column
        density and slope versus temperature for each cloud. For the
        case of OMC1, our results are consistent with those presented by

        modulates the input polarization signal thereby enabling removal
        of low-frequency (1/f) noise from polarized flux measurements.
        This 1/f noise arises from atmospheric turbulence as well as
        from effects intrinsic to certain detectors. Here, we describe
        the design and performance of the half wave plate rotator and
        achromatic half-wave plate for the the new imaging polarimeter,
        TolTEC. These components are mounted in front of the cryostat
        window and operate at ambient temperature. The Half-Wave Plate
        Rotator (HWPR) spins the half-wave plate at 2 revolutions per
        second. The rotation mechanism consists of nine air bearings to
        provide low-friction motion and a frameless torque motor to
        directly drive rotation. The orientation of the rotor and half-
        wave plate are recorded using a high-precision optical encoder.
        We review the experimental requirements and technical design of
        the rotator as well as the associated electronics, pneumatics,
        and software.}",

        a rapid-spinning achromatic half-wave plate, and once inside it
        passes through a 1 K Lyot stop that controls the telescope
        illumination. Inside the cryostat, a series of aluminum mirrors,
