I am an Astronomy PhD candidate in the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern University. I am also a part of the <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/">Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)</a>.

I am broadly interested in the magnetic field, astrophysical instrumentation (especially in the millimeter), and data reduction and analysis methods.

Currently, I am working with Prof. Giles Novak on building instruments to study the magnetic field in our Galaxy.
