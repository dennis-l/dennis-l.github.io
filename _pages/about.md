I am an Astronomy PhD candidate at Northwestern University and part of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA).
I am broadly interested in the magnetic field, astrophysical instrumentation (especially in the millimeter), and data reduction and analysis methods.
Currently, I am working with Prof. Giles Novak on building instruments to study the magnetic field in our Galaxy.
