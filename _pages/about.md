I am currently a <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/site/research/dennisl/">JPL Postdoctoral Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a>. I am broadly interested in interstellar dust, the role of the magnetic field in star formation, astrophysical instrumentation (especially in the millimeter), and data reduction and analysis methods.

I earned my Astronomy PhD from the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy at Northwestern University where I worked with Prof. Giles Novak on <a href="http://toltec.astro.umass.edu/">instrumentation</a> to study the magnetic field in our Galaxy. I was also a part of the <a href="https://ciera.northwestern.edu/">Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA)</a>.
